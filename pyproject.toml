description = "Tired of OOM errors and tedious file management? The AIIA Node Suite delivers the ultimate workflow overhaul, headlined by the AIIA Media Browser: a high-performance file hub fully integrated into ComfyUI. Instantly preview images, videos, and audio, and experience ultimate smoothness thanks to smart caching and virtual scrolling, even with tens of thousands of files. It also features a powerful fullscreen viewer, rich tooltip previews, and flexible sorting. Alongside the browser, our Video Combine node fundamentally solves memory bottlenecks in long video generation. By streaming frames from disk, you can create videos of virtually unlimited length, making OOM errors a thing of the past. The suite also includes OOM-safe FLOAT video generation, advanced audio processing, and other utilities, providing a complete end-to-end solution from content creation to asset management."
