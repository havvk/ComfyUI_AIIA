description = """A suite of powerful, intuitive, and highly customizable nodes for ComfyUI, featuring a high-performance Media Browser and OOM-safe video tools.

---
### Changelog v1.3.0
- **Major Feature**: Video workflow detection and loading is now supported! The browser can now detect and load workflows embedded in video files (e.g., MP4, WebM), just like with images.
- **Cache System**: Implemented a seamless cache upgrade to v3. This automatically clears old cache versions and rebuilds it to support new features without requiring any user action.

### Changelog v1.2.1
- **Bug Fix**: Restored the asynchronous loading behavior of the media browser. File lists now appear instantly while metadata (like thumbnails and workflow info) loads in the background, fixing a user experience regression from v1.2.0.

### Changelog v1.2.0
- **Features & Optimizations**:
  - Added one-click workflow loading and file downloading directly from the browser.
  - Implemented a manual refresh button and automatic refresh on view switching.
  - Redesigned icon buttons into a clean, hover-activated overlay.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed a race condition preventing the 'Load Workflow' button from appearing in list view.
  - Correctly sets workflow names on load for both standard and API formats.
  - Resolved issues with the icon sizing slider, ensuring instant and correct view updates.
